### I structured following questions with Dokata Benjamin as he needed some assistance for making a google form in order to get feedback on a HOT tool i.e [OpenAirelMap](https://openaerialmap.org/).
 
#### Our aim was to understand the user experience at specific touch points throughout their journey.  One thing we wanted to get is User Stories. In other words, we wanted to know what a type of user wants to do in order to achieve what goal.

I started off by going through the Tool and I wrote a brief detail regarding what the tool actually provides and who can be it's potential user. So that I can have an idea before actually framing the questions. You can find the details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vlPSV67Ze6VjY5a1Q3Tci0VfUi045dpqDt0fqgvJrbk/edit?usp=sharing).

Questions formed with the idea behind it are as follow:

*  In what ways do our products and services meet your needs? Or something like “What kind of performance is required by you in our product?” (In order to understand how and why they are actually using the product for?)
    
*  What needs are being unmet or “What kind of improvements/additional features would you like to see in our product so that it can meet your needs that you are currently unable to”? (In relation with the above question, together they both can answer the actual and complete need/demand for the user)
    
*  What are we doing right? (We can ask for a rating out 10 for their satisfaction with the services)
    
*  What could we be doing better or “What can we do to better meet your needs”? (Again this is similar to asking for suggestions but more specifically orientated to the personal objectives/needs of user this time)
    
* In order to have some idea regarding the characteristics of the user we can go for simple questions like - Can you give a brief introduction about yourself and why are you using this particular tool in order to achieve your work instead of the variety of products available in the market that more or less provide the similar services.
